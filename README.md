# MyRenderRaw
My first render restructured.
Able to render .obj file with triangle facets. Able to draw the mesh of an .obj file.
Learned and reuse lots of helpful code from https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki and PBRT.
Set the objViewer as the startup project and application.exe if using MSVC. Set other project as static library.
Create a directory /obj in the root directory to store the obj file.
